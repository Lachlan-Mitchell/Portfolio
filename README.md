# Portfolio

This portfolio project was designed for Nology students. It aims to tackle the concepts we have been learning in class. This project will require us to use HTML, SCSS with BEM naming convention. It is critical for us to ensure that we use a mobile design first as it is the most popular way to view the web as of 2022.

## MVP
 - The main requirements for this project were:

- The project needed to be stored/shared as a public repository on Github.
- The website needed to be styled using SCSS.
- The website needed to look good on all devices and therefore needed to be responsive.
- BEM naming convention should be used for scss selectors.
- The project also needed to be hosted live on Github pages.

As well the website needed to contain:

- A Landing page or section.
- An About page or section with a little bit about myself.
- A Projects page or section future projects that I am working on.
- A Skills page or section (to showcase the programming languages that I will be skilled in after the completion of the course.
-Links to my projects on Github

### Summary

Designing the webpage took many hours. After hours of browsing professional software developer portfolios. I decided to go with a simple approach whilst i only have a few avaliable tools  under my belt. HTML, SCSS, and the smallest JS I can use. Struggling with design ideas I tried to tackle the MVP's one step at a time. Finding major roadblocks with the media querys and BEM naming system that i was very unfamilar with. To overcome these challenges I researched breakpoints as much as i could and lived in dev tools looking at all the differnt layouts
