# Portfolio

This portfolio project was designed for Nology students. It aims to tackle the concepts we have been learning in class. This project will require us to use HTML, SCSS with BEM naming convention. It is critical for us to ensure that we use a mobile design first as it is the most popular way to view the web as of 2022.

## MVP
 - You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub
 - In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
 - You are to use SCSS for styling.
 - !!! Responsiveness is vital â€“ use Grid, Flex, whatever you wish but the site must look good on mobile phones. VERY CRITICAL! : You will need to make sure that your website looks good on phones, tablets and laptops (use media queries for at least checking whether the device is a mobile phone)
 - You must use BEM naming convention for scss selectors.
 - You must have the project hosted using github pages.

#### Your Portfolio should have the following section:

 - A landing page/section with your name and title on it.
 - An About page/section with a little bit about you
 - A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs you have learned during the course
 - A Project page/section with all your projects (use placeholder images and text at the beginning to render your website as it would with actual projects) - each project should have a little description, a link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub Repo (using a README.md at the root of the repo to include how you went about coding for that project)
 - A Contact page/section with your email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link.
